    <div class='materials'><strong>Extra Credit</strong> (up to one quiz worth, due 9-16)<br>
      Create a interactive sketch using three.js. If you turn in anything more complex than what we covered in class, you will get at least an extra 50% added to your cumulative quiz total at the end of class. If you turn in something fantastic, you will get 100% added (basically one free quizz). THERE IS NO PENALTY FOR NOT TURNING THIS IN, it is only extra credit. To submit the assignment, paste a link into the channel #extra-credit1 on Slack, along with your full name, by 9-16. Please don't clutter up the main thread of this Slack channel with any extra conversation outside of submissions (although using threads to heap praise on your classmates' work is great), this will make it easier to grade.
